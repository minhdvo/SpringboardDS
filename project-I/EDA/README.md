## Project: Capstone Project 1: Exploratory Data Analysis

Think of the following questions and apply them to your dataset:

1. Are there variables that are particularly significant in terms of explaining the answer to your project question?

2. Are there strong correlations between pairs of independent variables or between an independent and a dependent variable?

3. What are the most appropriate tests to use to analyse these relationships?
