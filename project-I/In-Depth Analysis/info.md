The techniques you’ll use in this project depend on your dataset so if you are unsure, ask your mentor to guide you on selecting the most appropriate methods.

Because each student’s individual dataset and project needs determine which techniques are used, we’ve found that the amount of time a student spends on this section varies quite a bit. Don’t be surprised if you find yourself spending more or less than the estimated time. Stay in touch with your mentor to ensure that you’re on track and defining a reasonable scope of work.
