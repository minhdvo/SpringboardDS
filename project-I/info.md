**Problem** <br>
Nowadays, we use a lot of energy for our daily activities at home, in businesses and industry as well as for transportation. To satisfy the demand of energy, different energy sources have been used in the United States. The energy can be classified into renewable (an energy source that can be replenished) and non-renewable (an energy source that cannot be easily replenished) types. In 2017, it was found that domestic energy production is around 90% of U.S. energy consumption. Currently, energy in the U.S. was consumed in five main purposes (commercial, residential, industrial, transportation and electric power). Depending on economic growth and other factors (such as weather and fuel prices), energy consumption for these sectors has been changed over time.  <br>
Due to the environmental issues, renewable energy has been considered to deploy more and more in practical uses. Many studies proved that renewable energy plays an important role in reducing greenhouse gas emission. Using renewable energy can reduce the use of fossil fuels, which are major imported sources of U.S. <br>
**Goals** <br>
The aim of this project is to predict the USA energy consumption of non-renewable and renewable energies in the next 5 years. <br>
**Data source** <br>
All data for my report were imported from website of U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) (https://www.eia.gov/). Total energy consumption of non-renewable and renewable energies in USA from 1960-2016 will be used for further analysis.

**Approach** <br>
- Collect data from EIA website via API query, csv and excel files.
- Analyze and extract required data for this report.
- Explore and visualize data of energy consumption.
- Construct a model for time series prediction.  

**Deliverables** <br>
- Jupyter notebooks 
- Final report
- PowerPoint slides
